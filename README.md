## about me

hey! i'm a self-taught developer who loves creating minecraft datapacks and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the game. i'm constantly learning and experimenting with new features, and i'm always looking for new challenges.

i'm available for commissions on custom datapacks, collaborations, and happy to chat about minecraft development. feel free to reach out!
